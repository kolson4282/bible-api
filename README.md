# Bible API WIP

Bible API to get bible character data based on chapter and location.

---

**Note: This is not connected yet but DB will build**

run `docker compose up` to start mysql database. Need to have a .env file with the following (can change values, this is just for example):

```
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD= root
DB_USER= user
DB_PASSWORD= dbpass
DB_NAME= bible_api
DB_HOST= db
SERVER_PORT= 8080
```
